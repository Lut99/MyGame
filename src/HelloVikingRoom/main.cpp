 * Auto updated?
 *   Yes

 * Description:
 *   This is the more mature version of our implementation for the Vulkan
 *   Tutorial, where we (hopefully) make the code a lot more structured by
 *   subdividing things in classes in their own files. Additionally, we
 *   move past the triangle here, to a square and then to a sample
 *   3D-model, which is a Viking Room.
