 * Description:
 *   The Renderpass class is used to define render passes. Unlike other
 *   Vulkan classes, such as the Instance or Device, a lot less is
 *   hardcoded, but instead the class provides more of a C++,
 *   RAII-compliant interface to the Vulkan class than that its a really
 *   separate entitity.
