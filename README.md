# MyGame
Repository for my own game with [Vulkan](https://www.khronos.org/vulkan/) as graphics library, [GLFW3](https://www.glfw.org/) as window library and [glm](https://github.com/g-truc/glm) as the mathmatics library. It also features our rundown through the tutorials (see below), which is a lot of code in an on itself thanks to Vulkan's boilerplate craze.

# Links
A lot of work with Vulkan is based on [this](https://vulkan-tutorial.com/) tutorial, with support from [this](https://paroj.github.io/gltut/Basics/Introduction.html) book.
